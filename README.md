# Speech-hate-dectecion
In this project, I use my trained Distilbert model, served through FastAPI, as the backend API to handle real-time predictions. It is served through FastAPI, which acts as the backend API to handle real-time predictions. This FastAPI service, along with the model artifacts, dependencies, and code, is containerized using Docker for portability, reproducibility, and environment consistency. The containerized application is then deployed to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service), providing scalability, networking, and cloud accessibility. Finally, a user-friendly frontend, built with HTML and CSS, allows users to input text and interact with the model via FastAPI, displaying real-time predictions and results for effective hate speech moderation. Here are the outputs:
